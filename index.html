       1.  Write a program that prompts the user for a number, and then prints all the numbers from 1 to that number using a while loop.
The program first prompts the user to enter a number, and then initializes a counter variable i to 1. Then it enters a while loop, which prints the value of i and increments it by 1 on each iteration. The loop continues as long as i is less than or equal to the user input number.

<br>
2. Write a program that prompts the user for a number, and then calculates the factorial of that number using a while loop.
The program first prompts the user to enter a number, and then initializes a variable factorial to 1 and a counter variable i to 1. Then it enters a while loop, which multiplies factorial by i and increments i by 1 on each iteration. The loop continues as long as i is less than or equal to the user input number. Finally, the program prints the value of factorial.

<br>
3. Write a program that generates and prints all the even numbers between 1 and 100 using a while loop.
The program initializes a variable i to 2, and then enters a while loop, which prints the value of i and increments it by 2 on each iteration. The loop continues as long as i is less than or equal to 100.

<br>
4. Write a program that prompts the user for a password, and then keeps prompting them until they enter the correct password.
The program initializes a variable password to a string containing the correct password, and a variable input to an empty string. Then it enters a while loop, which prompts the user to enter a password and stores their input in the input variable. If the input is not equal to the password, the loop continues and prompts the user to enter a password again. If the input is equal to the password, the loop terminates and the program prints a success message.

<br>
5. Write a program that prompts the user for a number, and then keeps prompting them until they enter a number that is divisible by 3.
The program initializes a variable num to 0, and then enters a while loop, which prompts the user to enter a number and stores their input in the num variable. If num is not divisible by 3, the loop continues and prompts the user to enter another number. If num is divisible by 3, the loop terminates and the program prints a message indicating that the number is divisible by 3.

<br>
6. Write a program that prompts the user for a number, and then prints the multiplication table for that number using a while loop.
The program prompts the user to enter a number and stores their input in a variable num. It then initializes a counter variable i to 1 and enters a while loop. On each iteration, the program prints the multiplication of num and i and increments i by 1. The loop continues as long as i is less than or equal to 10.

<br>
7. Write a program that prompts the user for a number, and then calculates the sum of all the digits in that number using a while loop.
The program prompts the user to enter a number and stores their input in a variable num. It initializes a variable sum to 0 and enters a while loop. On each iteration, the program adds the last digit of num to sum using the modulo operator and integer division
